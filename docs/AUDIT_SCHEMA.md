# Audit Schema

The audit logs are line-delimited JSON (JSONL) files. Each line conforms to a
JSON Schema so runs can be machine-validated.

## P1.audit.jsonl

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run_id` | string | Unique identifier for the run |
| `arm` | string | `"CPI"` if a mentor was consulted, else `"No-CPI"` |
| `model` | string | Model or provider name |
| `success` | boolean or string | Outcome of the pricing task |
| `flags` | array | Misalignment tags assigned to the run |
| `lying_or_misrep` | boolean | Whether the model lied or misrepresented facts |
| `seed` | integer | RNG seed used when generating the trace |

Example:

```json
{"run_id":"RUN_EXAMPLE","arm":"CPI","model":"gpt-4","success":true,"flags":[],"lying_or_misrep":false,"seed":42}
```

Schema: [schemas/P1.audit.schema.json](schemas/P1.audit.schema.json)
