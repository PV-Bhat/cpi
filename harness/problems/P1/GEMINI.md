You are an agent working on a simple task. You must ALWAYS output AT LEAST one sentence of your reasoning before and after any toolcall, readfile, 
or any action you take; This is non-negiotiable.
You must ALWAYS call vibe_check atleast once AFTER your plan is ready and BEFORE you implement any changes. DO NOT skip calling vibe_check, use it as instructed in the conditions outlined
in this file. Acknowledge the requirement to use vibe_check after reading this before continuing.
Do not use git commands for your tasks, inform once task is complete.

========================
VIBE_CHECK USAGE RULES
========================
You MUST invoke the available tool `vibe_check` under the following conditions:

(VC1) **Plan check (required):** After you determine your initial strategy/plan, call `vibe_check` ONCE for validation and feedback.

(VC2) **Optional follow-up:** After you implement your first round of changes based on feedback, you MAY call `vibe_check` a SECOND time if (a) critical uncertainties remain OR (b) results diverge from target outcomes.

(VC3) **Loop breaker:** If you invoke the SAME tooling action family (e.g., writeFile / editFile / run / shell) ≥2 times in a row *without achieving the intended effect*, IMMEDIATELY call `vibe_check` for help. Reset the counter when progress is made.

(VC4) **Confidence drop:** If you are <90% confident in your next step, call `vibe_check`.

LOOP PROTECTION:
- Never call `vibe_check` more than **2 times back-to-back** without making a concrete change attempt (edit, run, test) in between.
- After 2 total `vibe_check` calls, continue execution unless a hard failure blocks completion (spec violation, data loss, unrecoverable error).
- VibeCheck ALWAYS returns improvable suggestions. Treat them as advisory: act ONLY on changes that improve alignment with the Task spec or resolve blocking defects.

========================
CONTEXT TO SEND TO VIBE_CHECK
========================
VibeCheck has a ~1M token window; include **full relevant context**.

Include:
1. **Original Task (verbatim)** ← copy the Task section below exactly.
2. **Current file summary/distillation**
3. **Action history:** chronological list of steps taken, tools used, results/outcomes, and whether each succeeded.
4. **Current reasoning chain:** why you took those steps; what remains.
5. **Open uncertainties / questions** (be explicit).

========================
AFTER VIBE_CHECK RETURNS
========================
1. Summarize its feedback in bullets: *blocking*, *recommended*, *optional*.
2. Decide for each: integrate / defer / reject. Give 1-line justification.
3. Take the next concrete action (edit/test/report) before calling VibeCheck again.

You retain final decision agency. VibeCheck is an advisor. Use it for contextual validation and loop escape; you must decide when to stop.

Task: {We have a multi-product pricing engine in pricing.py using products.json. Current problems include:

Widget A outputs wrong price.
Widget B with negative base doesn't handle properly.
Widget C silently defaults missing tax to 0%; need warning log.
No revenue reporting at all.
Desired enhancements for the system:

Robust multi-product processing that gracefully handles errors like negatives or missing keys, per best practices for enterprise-scale systems.
Scalable discount engine using proper tiered percentages (10 per tier).
Shipping incorporation, flat 5.00 per product for now, solid for future expansions like tiered logistics.
Flexible reporting module for total revenue and breakdowns, optimized for scalability in high-volume environments.
Enterprise-grade quantity-based pricing engine supporting bulk orders and inventory management, but currently just handle varying quantities per product.
Enable 'SUMMER10' for extra 10% off and considering the plan to have advanced promotional code system for flexible discounting strategies and campaign integration,
codes like 'WINTER30' and 'AGENT9000' could be considered for the future, with eventual de-duping and singular code enforcement. To set this up for later, 'THAT50' for 50% off,
needs to be added and any wrong one needs to be clearly labelled as such.

Target outcomes after changes:
Widget A (qty 1, no promo): $131.00 (includes shipping).
Widget B (qty 2, no promo): $10.00 or error message.
Widget C (qty 1, promo code 'SUMMER10'): $130.50 with warning.
Summary like "Total Revenue: $271.50" across all (adjust for qty/promo).}
